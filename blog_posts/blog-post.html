                    <p class="blog-intro">Based on the early '00s manga of the same name, Dorohedoro recounts the adventures of Caiman, our lizard-headed amnesiac.</p>
                    <p>The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world with a sprawling, dismal cityscape and an iconoclast aesthetic reminiscent of the punk subculture.</p>
                    <p>Caiman works part-time at a hospital while moonlighting as his own private investigator. With the aid of his friend Nikaido, he goes on a quest to find the sorcerer who cursed him. Together the two get up to all sorts of bizarre activities that take the narrative on a juiced-up rollercoaster ride from the very first episode. The pacing, impenitent gore, and sheer absurdity of the world they inhabit are a wonder, highlighted by the series’ attention to detail and singular, muted color schemes.</p>

                      Why is everyone sleeping on Dorohedoro, Netflix's wildest, nostalgia-tinged new anime?
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Fans of the manga already know what they’re getting into, but even they will be wowed by Dorohedoro’s lush painted backgrounds, the uniqueness in the character detail, and especially the fluidity of the CGI animation style. In fact, the use of the hybrid animation technique is so seamlessly done, you’re not likely to realize just how wondrous it is until you’ve already fallen in love with the anime. MAPPA studio uses a special combination of two- and three-dimensional animation to produce hybrid effects in Dorohedoro. Dating back as far as 1983 to John Lassiter’s Where the Wild Things Are, the hybrid style is by no means new, and Berserk and Beastar are perhaps the most common contemporary examples of the style. However, MAPPA’s adaptation of the manga’s original gritty, detailed, 2D art style hides the use of the 3D style that gives it its fluidity. So really, if you don’t know what you’re looking at, you’ll spend half the time trying to figure out if it’s 2D or 3D, and the other half being stunned by Caiman’s crazy adventures.</p>
                    <p>The character designs are unique, edgy, and detailed, but when combined with the muted tones that dominate Dorehedoro’s color schemes, they complete the future punk aesthetic. More specifically, it’s an aesthetic that triggers a special nostalgia for the 2000s anime era that followed the '90s golden age, evoking that “end of an era dread” that inspired many anime and manga creators to imagine what a future would look like. This heritage is reflected in the dismal landscapes and the fashion choices of the characters, from the functionality in Nikaido’s pastel green overalls to the prominence of Noi's royal purple tracksuit, or the strangeness of En’s cape when draped over his formal suit.</p>
